# Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

This repo contains ARM templates of individual Azure resources and larger or guided deployments to support common cloud architectures.

## Repository Layout

This repo is split into two sections. The [deployment patterns](https://github.com/MattDaines/Azure-ARM/blob/master/Patterns/README.md) section links to a README file containing the directory of patterns. The aim of these pattern templates are to support a complete build in a single or multiple deployments. If you're not after a complete deployment, I've also created [individual resource templates](https://github.com/MattDaines/Azure-ARM/tree/master/Individual) that can be used to deploy incrementally.
